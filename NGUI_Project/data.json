We developed PerCon, a data management and analysis environment, to support such activities. PerCon processes and integrates data gathered via queries to existing data providers to create a personal digital library of data. Users may then search, browse, visualize and annotate the data as they proceed with analysis and interpretation. Interpretation in PerCon takes place in a visual workspace in which multiple data visualizations and annotations are placed into spatial arrangements based on the current task. The system watches for patterns in the userâs data selection and organization and through mixed-initiative interaction assists users by suggesting potentially relevant data from unexplored data sources. PerConâs data location and analysis capabilities were evaluated in a controlled study with 24 users. Study participants had to locate and analyze heterogeneous weather and river data with and without the visual workspace and mixed-initiative interaction, respectively. Results indicate that the visual workspace facilitated information representation and aided in the identification of relationships between datasets. The systemâs suggestions encouraged data exploration, leading participants to identify more evidence of correlation among data streams and more potential interactions among weather and river data.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"acc3f66b-d6dc-358a-95f3-6951849aade6","title":"The End of an Architectural Era (It is Time for a Complete Rewrite)","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Michael Stonebraker","Samuel Madden","Daniel J Abadi","Stavros Harizopoulos","Nabil Hachem","Pat Helland"],"keywords":["wise"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"In previous papers SC05, SBC+07, some of us predicted the end of \"one size fits all\" as a commercial relational DBMS paradigm. These papers presented reasons and experimental evidence that showed that the major RDBMS vendors can be outperformed by 1-2 orders of magnitude by specialized engines in the data warehouse, stream processing, text, and scientific database markets. Assuming that specialized engines dominate these markets over time, the current relational DBMS code lines will be left with the business data processing (OLTP) market and hybrid markets where more than one kind of capability is required. In this paper we show that current RDBMSs can be beaten by nearly two orders of magnitude in the OLTP market as well. The experimental evidence comes from comparing a new OLTP prototype, H-Store, which we have built at M.I.T. to a popular RDBMS on the standard transactional benchmark, TPC-C. We conclude that the current RDBMS code lines, while attempting to be a \"one size fits all\" solution, in fact, excel at nothing. Hence, they are 25 year old legacy code lines that should be retired in favor of a collection of \"from scratch\" specialized engines. The DBMS vendors (and the research community) should start with a clean sheet of paper and design systems for tomorrow\u0027s requirements, not continue to push code lines and architectures designed for yesterday\u0027s needs.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"e75fe1f5-e27d-38ac-919a-946f6117a637","title":"Laevo: A Temporal Desktop Interface for Integrated Knowledge Work","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Steven Jeuris","Steven Houben","Jakob Bardram"],"keywords":["desktop","interface","knowledge"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Prior studies show that knowledge work is characterized by highly interlinked practices, including task, file and window management. However, existing personal information management tools primarily focus on a limited subset of knowledge work, forcing users to perform additional manual configuration work to integrate the different tools they use. In order to understand tool usage, we review literature on how users\u0027 activities are created and evolve over time as part of knowledge worker practices. From this we derive the activity life cycle, a conceptual framework describing the different states and transitions of an activity. The life cycle is used to inform the design of Laevo, a temporal activity-centric desktop interface for personal knowledge work. Laevo allows users to structure work within dedicated workspaces, managed on a timeline. Through a centralized notification system which doubles as a to-do list, incoming interruptions can be handled. Our field study indicates how highlighting the temporal nature of activities results in lightweight scalable activity management, while making users more aware about their ongoing and planned work.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"4608262b-21ce-39ed-8020-9640f7d01604","title":"Ontologies and the brain: Using spreading activation through ontologies to support personal interaction","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Akrivi Katifori","Costas Vassilakis","Alan Dix"],"keywords":["Ontology","Personal interaction","Personal ontology","Spreading activation","User tasks"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Ontologies, as knowledge engineering tools, allow information to be modelled in ways resembling to those used by the human brain, and may be very useful in the context of personal information management (PIM) and task information management (TIM).

Our system \"Presentation Sensei\" is equipped with a microphone and camera to analyze a presentation by combining speech and image processing techniques. Based on the results of the analysis, the system gives the speaker instant feedback with respect to the speaking rate, eye contact with the audience, and timing. It also alerts the speaker when some of these indices exceed predefined warning thresholds. After the presentation, the system generates visual summaries of the analysis results for the speaker\u0027s self-examinations. Our goal is not to improve the content on a semantic level, but to improve the delivery of it by reducing inappropriate basic behavior patterns. We asked a few test users to try the system and they found it very useful for improving their presentations. We also compared the system\u0027s output with the observations of a human evaluator. The result shows that the system successfully detected some inappropriate behavior.

The state-of-the-art solutions to the Big Data problem are largely based on the MapReduce framework (aka its open source implementation Hadoop). Although Hadoop handles the data volume challenge successfully, it does not deal with the data variety well since MapReduce enforces a key-value data model along with a row-oriented data processing strategy and bundles the data processing model with the underlying concurrent programming model. This paper presents epiC, an extensible system to tackle the Big Dataâs data variety challenge. epiC introduces a general Actor-like concurrent programming model, independent of the data processing models, for specifying parallel computations. Users process multi-structured datasets with appropriate epiC extensions, the implementation of a data processing model best suited for the data type and auxiliary code for mapping that data processing model into epiCâs concurrent programming model. Like Hadoop, programs written in this way can be automatically parallelized and the runtime system takes care of fault tolerance and inter-machine communications. We present the design and implementation of epiCâs concurrent programming model. We also present two customized data processing model, an optimized MapReduce extension and a relational model, on top of epiC.

Rather than exposing real-world data and functionality through proprietary and tightly-coupled systems, we propose to make them an integral part of the Web. As a result, smart things become easier to build upon. Popular Web languages (e.g., HTML, Python, JavaScript, PHP) can be used to easily build applications involving smart things and users can leverage well-known Web mechanisms (e.g., browsing, searching, bookmarking, caching, linking) to interact and share these devices. In this paper, we begin by describing the Web of Things architecture and best-practices based on the RESTful principles that have already contributed to the popular success, scalability, and modularity of the traditional Web. We then discuss several prototypes designed in accordance with these principles to connect environmental sensor nodes and an energy monitoring system to the World Wide Web. We finally show how Web-enabled smart things can be used in lightweight ad-hoc applications called âphysical mashupsâ.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"9ce3f516-f6f3-33ea-a6fc-932496ac028b","title":"MindXpres: An Extensible Content-driven Cross-Media Presentation Platform","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Reinout Roels","Beat Signer"],"keywords":["cross-media transclusion","mindxpres","non-linear","slideware"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Existing presentation tools and document formats show a number of shortcomings in terms of the management, visualisation and navigation of rich cross-media content.

Aiming to link the multiple visions for the next phase of GIS development, this article suggests that the emerging open GIS should serve as a guiding concept. Contextualized in the broader literature of open science, this article proposes open GIS should include eight dimensions related to data, software, hardware, standards, research, publication, funding, and education. For the GIS community, open GIS offers four exciting opportunities: (1) technology-driven opportunities for addressing challenges posed by the (spatial) big data deluge; (2) application-led opportunities for confronting the problems of a rapidly changing planet; (3) curiosity-inspired, crowd-powered opportunities for the development of an open and geographic citizen science; and (4) education-focused opportunities for implementing the vision of a spatial university. Although there are academic, legal, social/political, and environmental impediments for the practice of open GIS, open GIS will become increasingly important in shaping our research and educational agendas in the future.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"d485e0d7-de2e-3cb9-bf5b-79a96e998f83","title":"Graduate student use of a multi-slate reading system","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Nicholas Chen","FranÃ§ois GuimbretiÃ¨re","Abigail Sellen"],"keywords":["academia","deployment","e-book","e-reading","graduate students","multi-screen computing","multi-slate","reading","tablet"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":["Paper writing"],"content":"In laboratory studies, multi-surface slate-based reading sys- tems have shown great promise as platforms for active reading.

Process variants are complex objects that contain features of different dimensions, such as variant design or variant execution data. This paper provides a technique for effective utilization of the adaptations manifested in process variants. In particular, we will present a facility for discovery of preferred variants through effective search and retrieval based on the notion of process similarity, where multiple aspects of the process variants are compared according to specific query requirements. The major advantage of this approach is the ability to provide a quantitative measure for the similarity between process variants, which further facilitates various BPM activities such as process reuse, analysis and discovery.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"4c9fc040-ca4f-38a8-955b-d8205dd63b88","title":"From User Needs to Opportunities in Personal Information Management: A Case Study on Organisational Strategies in Cross-Media Information Spaces","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Sandra Trullemans","Beat Signer"],"keywords":["cross-media information spaces","definition of files","mixing","organisational strategies","personal information management","piles","pim"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":["Next Generation UI project"],"content":"The efficient management of our daily information in phys- ical and digital information spaces is a well-known prob- lem.

This often leads to poor discovery results, because the keywords in the query can be semantically similar but syntactically different, or syntactically similar but semantically different from the terms in a service description. Another drawback of the existing service discovery mechanisms is that the query-service matching score is calculated taking into account only the keywords from the userâs query and the terms in the service descriptions. Thus, regardless of the context of the service user and the context of the services providers, the same list of results is returned in response to a particular query.

It is unclear, however, which contextual factors are important and to which degree they influence user ratings. A large amount of data and complex context-aware predictive models must be exploited to understand these relationships. In this paper, we take a new approach for assessing and modeling the relationship between contextual factors and item ratings. Rather than using the traditional approach to data collection, where recommendations are rated with respect to real situations as participants go about their lives as normal, we simulate contextual situations to more easily capture data regarding how the context influences user ratings. To this end, we have designed a methodology whereby users are asked to judge whether a contextual factor (e.g., season) influences the rating given a certain contextual condition (e.g., season is summer). Based on the analyses of these data, we built a context-aware mobile recommender system that utilizes the contextual factors shown to be important.

Similarity among users or items is calculated purely based on rating overlap in this case,without considering explicit properties of users or items involved, limiting their applicability in domains with very sparse rating spaces. In many domains such as movies, news or electronic commerce recommenders, considerable contextual data in text form describing item properties is available along with the rating data, which could be utilized to improve recommendation quality.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve standard CF based recommenders by utilizing latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to learn latent properties of items, expressed in terms of topic proportions, derived from their textual description. We infer user\u0027s topic preferences or persona in the same latent space,based on her historical ratings. While computing similarity between users, we make use of a combined similarity measure involving rating overlap as well as similarity in the latent topic space. This approach alleviates sparsity problem as it allows calculation of similarity between users even if they have not rated any items in common. Our experiments on multiple public datasets indicate that the proposed hybrid approach significantly outperforms standard user Based and item Based CF recommenders in terms of classification accuracy metrics such as precision, recall and f-measure.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"b3e80387-467d-3e0f-b8b8-5708f62fbdb4","title":"Using Social Data as Context for Making Recommendations : An Ontology based Approach","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Salma Noor","Kirk Martinez"],"keywords":["Context","Cultural Heritage","Ontologies","Recommender Systems","Semantic Web","Web 2.0","linked data","tagging","user interest modeling"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Web-based knowledge systems support an impressive and growing amount of information.

To provide a more robust approach to context gathering we propose the use of Social Web technologies alongside the Semantic Web. As the social web is heavily used it could provide a better understanding of a userâs interests and intentions. The proposed system gathers information about users from their social web identities and enriches it with ontological knowledge. Thus an interest model for the user can be created which can serve as a good source of contextual knowledge. This work bridges the gap between the user and system searches by analyzing the virtual existence of a user and making interesting recommendations accordingly.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"f426b571-19ac-305f-b9f4-feb64852701f","title":"A multimedia semantic recommender system for cultural heritage applications","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Massimiliano Albanese","Antonio D\u0027Acierno","Vincenzo Moscato","Fabio Persia","Antonio Picariello"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"One of the most important challenge in the information access field is information overload.

In this paper we propose an approach for the exploitation of digital libraries for personalization goal in cultural heritage scenario. Specifically, we tried to integrate FIRSt (Folksonomy-based Item Recommender syStem), a content-based recommender system developed at the University of Bari, and Fedora, a flexible digital library architecture, in a framework for the adaptive fruition of cultural heritage implemented within the activities of the CHAT research project. In this scenario, the role of the digital library was to store information (such as textual and multimedial ones) about paintings gathered from the Vatican Picture Gallery and to provide them in a multimodal and personalized way through a PDA device given to a user before her visit in a museum. This paper describes the system architecture of our recommender system and its integration in the framework implemented for the CHAT project, showing how this recommendation model has been applied to recommend the artworks located at the Vatican Picture Gallery (Pinacoteca Vaticana), providing users with a personalized museum tour tailored on their tastes. The experimental evaluation we performed also confirmed that these recommendation services are really able to catch the real user preferences thus improving their experience in cultural heritage fruition. \u0026copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"42037da2-6eb5-3f36-90c3-9a30bd01359f","title":"Using and Determining Location in a Context-Sensitive Tour Guide: The GUIDE Experience","datatype":"Publication","authors":["N Davies","K Cheverst","K Mitchell","A Efrat"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"kind":"Digital"},{"id":"d041850b-3b42-364d-afd5-b7366fbfef1b","title":"Incorporating contextual information in recommender systems using a multidimensional approach","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Gediminas Adomavicius","Ramesh Sankaranarayanan","Shahana Sen","Alexander Tuzhilin"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"The article presents a multidimensional (MD) approach to recommender systems that can provide recommendations based on additional contextual information besides the typical information on users and items used in most of the current recommender systems.

Various recommender system techniques have been proposed since the mid-1990s, and many sorts of recommender system software have been developed recently for a variety of applications. Researchers and managers recognize that recommender systems offer great opportunities and challenges for business, government, education, and other domains, with more recent successful developments of recommender systems for real-world applications becoming apparent. It is thus vital that a high quality, instructive review of current trends should be conducted, not only of the theoretical research results but more importantly of the practical developments in recommender systems. This paper therefore reviews up-to-date application developments of recommender systems, clusters their applications into eight main categories: e-government, e-business, e-commerce/e-shopping, e-library, e-learning, e-tourism, e-resource services and e-group activities, and summarizes the related recommendation techniques used in each category. It systematically examines the reported recommender systems through four dimensions: recommendation methods (such as CF), recommender systems software (such as BizSeeker), real-world application domains (such as e-business) and application platforms (such as mobile-based platforms). Some significant new topics are identified and listed as new directions. By providing a state-of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers and practical professionals in their understanding of developments in recommender system applications.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"2d67588b-e320-37f0-97ea-fcb332c05a26","title":"Mobile, client-side context-provisioning via the integrated querying of online semantic web data","datatype":"Publication","authors":["William Van Woensel"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Mobile devices capabilities have increased tremendously over the last few years, enabling mobile users to run resource-heavy applications, such as route planners, web browsers and games, at any time and any place. Much work has been done to facilitate interaction with mobile applications, in mobile settings and on devices with relatively small screens and cumbersome input features. For instance, multi-touch, gesture and voice recognition are deployed to easily execute certain actions, while obtrusiveness of mobile interactions is adapted to suit the userâs current situation (e.g., in a meeting). However, mobile interactions still have inherent limitations, mainly due to the fact they are mobile in the first place; mobile users often do not have the time, or the comfortable desktop-setting, to interact with mobile applications. In order to cope with such limitations, the mobile userâs context can further be leveraged. Context is defined as any piece of information related to application interaction, including information on the userâs surroundings as well as the user and device. By automatically presenting information and services suiting the userâs current context, mobile interactions can be enhanced. For example, considering the mobile userâs current surroundings and preferences, he can be notified of nearby shops selling items on his shopping list, or nearby public transportation stations leading back to his hotel. In this dissertation, we present a client-side framework to provision context in mobile settings, which exploits recent evolutions in mobile device technology and the World Wide Web. By leveraging increased mobile processing power and memory capacity, computationally intensive tasks, such as context interpretation, integration and dissemination, are performed locally on the mobile device itself. Furthermore, the machine-readable Semantic Web, the next step in the evolution of the Web, is utilized as an online platform for retrieving context data. Much useful context information, describing people, places and things in the userâs vicinity, is already captured in small, machine-readable online web sources; including websites (e.g., shops, monuments) and online RDF files (e.g., person profiles). As websites are being increasingly semantically annotated, making the meaning of their content explicit, many of them have become fully-fledged semantic data sources as well. In order to achieve transparent, integrated query access to such small online semantic sources, this dissertation further presents a mobile, client-side query service. This query service comprises indexing and caching components to enable querying such an online dataset on mobile devices.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"edf6b35c-dcb6-3538-b38b-40f23f53d4a6","title":"A systematic review of scholar context-aware recommender systems","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Zohreh Dehghani Champiri","Seyed Reza Shahamiri","Siti Salwah Binti Salim"],"keywords":["context-aware recommender system"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"kind":"Digital"},{"id":"7e61e461-7b0f-364b-a593-8fd2089a4f9f","title":"Adaptation in context-aware pervasive information systems: the SECAS project","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Tarak Chaari and FrÃ©dÃ©rique Laforest","Augusto Celentano"],"keywords":["computer applications","computing and communications","information systems","international journal of pervasive","paper type research paper"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"kind":"Digital"},{"id":"d6a3df13-401d-3600-97bf-a48ba334ccea","title":"LNAI 7301 - Hybrid-\u003cTEX\u003e$\\epsilon$\u003c/TEX\u003e-greedy for Mobile Context-Aware Recommender System","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Djallel Bouneffouf","Amel Bouzeghoub","Alda Lopes GanÃ§arski"],"keywords":["contextual bandit","exploitation dilemma","exploration","machine learning","personalization","recommender","systems"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"kind":"Digital"},{"id":"6c92a3f6-b985-3ee1-af57-d5f5c42c18c9","title":"The YouTube video recommendation system","datatype":"Publication","authors":["James Davidson","Blake Livingston","Dasarathi Sampath","Benjamin Liebald","Junning Liu","Palash Nandy","Taylor Van Vleet","Ullas Gargi","Sujoy Gupta","Yu He","Mike Lambert"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"We discuss the video recommendation system in use at YouTube, the worldâs most popular online video commu- nity.

Empirical research has shown that, even after school instruction, students do not understand essential ecological concepts. The main reason is that preconceptions which influence learning are not taken into account in the construction of curricula. We combine findings from two independently-designed studies which have their main objectives in common. In both studies the focus is on students\u0027 conceptions of ecological terms and phenomena-ecosystem, and balance-and-change in nature. The studies were conducted within the framework of Educational Reconstruction, where three components of research are linked together: \u0027scientific clarification\u0027, \u0027comprehension of students\u0027 perspectives\u0027 and \u0027construction of instruction\u0027. In order to capture the structure and quality of students\u0027 conceptions, qualitative methods were used. The results of both studies indicate that students tend to refer to more or less constant properties, in particular those which are visible in the everyday world. Processes are rarely their concern. Therefore the scientific conceptions of ecosystem, imbalance and the dynamics of biodiversity would be difficult for them to understand. For a better understanding, the dimensions of both space and time should be included in curricular design.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"ec096156-4027-3b0f-b6b4-6f20c560ee8d","title":"Understanding context before using it","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Mary Bazire","Patrick BrÃ©zillon"],"keywords":["context","contextual elements","definition"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"This paper presents an attempt to point out some problematic issues about the understanding of context. Although frequently used in cognitive sciences or other disciplines, context stays a very ill-defined concept. Our goal is to identify the main components of the context on the basis of the analysis of a corpus of 150 definitions coming mainly from the web in different domains of cognitive sciences and close disciplines. We analyzed this corpus of definitions through two methods, namely LSA [1], [2] and STONE [3], [4], and we conclude that finally the content of all the definitions can be analyzed in terms of few parameters like constraint, influence, behavior, nature, structure and system.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"6aee9824-94ad-3a44-a01b-0e77df4024d4","title":"Gestural Interfaces: A Step Backward In Usability","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Donald a Norman","Jakob Nielsen","Nielsen Norman Group"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"One step forward, two steps back. Once again, the usability crisis is upon us. We suspect most of you thought it was over. After all, HCI certainly understands how to make things usable, so the emphasis has shifted to more engaging topics, such as new applications, new technological developments, and the challenges of social networks and ubiquitous connection and commu- nication. Well, you were wrong. In a recent column for interac- tions, Norman pointed out that in the rush to develop gestural (or ânaturalâ) interfaces, well- tested and understood standards of interaction design were being overthrown, ignored, and violated [1]. Yes, new technologies require new methods, but the refusal to follow well-established principles leads to usability disaster. Recently, Raluca Budui and Hoa Loranger from the Nielsen Norman Group performed usability tests on Appleâs iPad, reaching much the same conclu- sion. The new applications for gestural control in smart cell phones (notably the iPhone and Android devices) and the coming arrival of larger screen devices built upon gestural operating systems (starting with Appleâs iPad) promise even more opportunities for well-intended developers to screw things up. Nielsen put it this way: âThe first crop of iPad apps revived memories of Web designs from 1993, when Mosaic first introduced the image map that made it possible for any part of any picture to become a UI element. As a result, graphic designers went wild: Anything they could draw could be a UI, whether it made sense or not. Itâs the same with iPad apps: Anything you can show and touch can be a UI on this device. There are no standards and no expectations.â [2]","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"3acc88c6-7d0f-35ed-954c-ac728ece5ec6","title":"Radical Atoms : Beyond Tangible Bits , Toward Transformable Materials","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Hiroshi Ishii","DÃ¡vid Lakatos","Leonardo Bonanni","Jean-Baptiste Jb Labrune"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) let users see digital information only through a screen, as if looking into a pool of water, as depicted in Figure 1 on page 40.

Now imagine an iceberg, a mass of ice that penetrates the surface of the water and provides a handle for the mass beneath. This metaphor describes tangible user interfaces: They act as physical manifestations of computation, allowing us to interact directly with the portion that is made tangibleâthe âtip of the icebergâ (Figure 1b). Radical Atoms takes a leap beyond tangible interfaces by assuming a hypothetical generation of materials that can change form and appearance dynamically, so they are as reconfigurable as pixels on a screen. Radical Atoms is a vision for the future of human-material interactions, in which all digital information has physical manifestation so that we can interact directly with itâas if the iceberg had risen from the depths to reveal its sunken mass (Figure 1c).","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"3e42f4a7-5650-363f-aafd-7455710a0e22","title":"Interactive Paper: Past, Present and Future","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Beat Signer","Moira C Norrie"],"keywords":["Anoto","Augmented Paper","Digital Pen and Paper","Interactive Paper","Paper-Digital Interfaces"],"createdDate":"Dec 8, 2015 5:21:13 AM","tasks":["Read this paper for exam"],"content":"Over the last few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of researchers dealing with the integration of paper and digital information or services.

The state-of-the-art solutions to the Big Data problem are largely based on the MapReduce framework (aka its open source implementation Hadoop). Although Hadoop handles the data volume challenge successfully, it does not deal with the data variety well since MapReduce enforces a key-value data model along with a row-oriented data processing strategy and bundles the data processing model with the underlying concurrent programming model. This paper presents epiC, an extensible system to tackle the Big Data’s data variety challenge. epiC introduces a general Actor-like concurrent programming model, independent of the data processing models, for specifying parallel computations. Users process multi-structured datasets with appropriate epiC extensions, the implementation of a data processing model best suited for the data type and auxiliary code for mapping that data processing model into epiC’s concurrent programming model. Like Hadoop, programs written in this way can be automatically parallelized and the runtime system takes care of fault tolerance and inter-machine communications. We present the design and implementation of epiC’s concurrent programming model. We also present two customized data processing model, an optimized MapReduce extension and a relational model, on top of epiC. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our proposed epiC.","kind":"Digital"}],"links":[{"source":0,"target":1,"type":"Keyword","value":["wise"]},{"source":4,"target":6,"type":"Keyword","value":["presentation"]},{"source":6,"target":10,"type":"Authorship","value":["Reinout
