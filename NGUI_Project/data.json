We developed PerCon, a data management and analysis environment, to support such activities. PerCon processes and integrates data gathered via queries to existing data providers to create a personal digital library of data. Users may then search, browse, visualize and annotate the data as they proceed with analysis and interpretation. Interpretation in PerCon takes place in a visual workspace in which multiple data visualizations and annotations are placed into spatial arrangements based on the current task. The system watches for patterns in the userâs data selection and organization and through mixed-initiative interaction assists users by suggesting potentially relevant data from unexplored data sources. PerConâs data location and analysis capabilities were evaluated in a controlled study with 24 users. Study participants had to locate and analyze heterogeneous weather and river data with and without the visual workspace and mixed-initiative interaction, respectively. Results indicate that the visual workspace facilitated information representation and aided in the identification of relationships between datasets. The systemâs suggestions encouraged data exploration, leading participants to identify more evidence of correlation among data streams and more potential interactions among weather and river data.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"acc3f66b-d6dc-358a-95f3-6951849aade6","title":"The End of an Architectural Era (It is Time for a Complete Rewrite)","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Michael Stonebraker","Samuel Madden","Daniel J Abadi","Stavros Harizopoulos","Nabil Hachem","Pat Helland"],"keywords":["wise"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"content":"In previous papers SC05, SBC+07, some of us predicted the end of \"one size fits all\" as a commercial relational DBMS paradigm. These papers presented reasons and experimental evidence that showed that the major RDBMS vendors can be outperformed by 1-2 orders of magnitude by specialized engines in the data warehouse, stream processing, text, and scientific database markets. Assuming that specialized engines dominate these markets over time, the current relational DBMS code lines will be left with the business data processing (OLTP) market and hybrid markets where more than one kind of capability is required. In this paper we show that current RDBMSs can be beaten by nearly two orders of magnitude in the OLTP market as well. The experimental evidence comes from comparing a new OLTP prototype, H-Store, which we have built at M.I.T. to a popular RDBMS on the standard transactional benchmark, TPC-C. We conclude that the current RDBMS code lines, while attempting to be a \"one size fits all\" solution, in fact, excel at nothing. Hence, they are 25 year old legacy code lines that should be retired in favor of a collection of \"from scratch\" specialized engines. The DBMS vendors (and the research community) should start with a clean sheet of paper and design systems for tomorrow\u0027s requirements, not continue to push code lines and architectures designed for yesterday\u0027s needs.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"e75fe1f5-e27d-38ac-919a-946f6117a637","title":"Laevo: A Temporal Desktop Interface for Integrated Knowledge Work","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Steven Jeuris","Steven Houben","Jakob Bardram"],"keywords":["desktop","interface","knowledge"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Prior studies show that knowledge work is characterized by highly interlinked practices, including task, file and window management. However, existing personal information management tools primarily focus on a limited subset of knowledge work, forcing users to perform additional manual configuration work to integrate the different tools they use. In order to understand tool usage, we review literature on how users\u0027 activities are created and evolve over time as part of knowledge worker practices. From this we derive the activity life cycle, a conceptual framework describing the different states and transitions of an activity. The life cycle is used to inform the design of Laevo, a temporal activity-centric desktop interface for personal knowledge work. Laevo allows users to structure work within dedicated workspaces, managed on a timeline. Through a centralized notification system which doubles as a to-do list, incoming interruptions can be handled. Our field study indicates how highlighting the temporal nature of activities results in lightweight scalable activity management, while making users more aware about their ongoing and planned work.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"4608262b-21ce-39ed-8020-9640f7d01604","title":"Ontologies and the brain: Using spreading activation through ontologies to support personal interaction","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Akrivi Katifori","Costas Vassilakis","Alan Dix"],"keywords":["Ontology","Personal interaction","Personal ontology","Spreading activation","User tasks"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Ontologies, as knowledge engineering tools, allow information to be modelled in ways resembling to those used by the human brain, and may be very useful in the context of personal information management (PIM) and task information management (TIM).

Our system \"Presentation Sensei\" is equipped with a microphone and camera to analyze a presentation by combining speech and image processing techniques. Based on the results of the analysis, the system gives the speaker instant feedback with respect to the speaking rate, eye contact with the audience, and timing. It also alerts the speaker when some of these indices exceed predefined warning thresholds. After the presentation, the system generates visual summaries of the analysis results for the speaker\u0027s self-examinations. Our goal is not to improve the content on a semantic level, but to improve the delivery of it by reducing inappropriate basic behavior patterns. We asked a few test users to try the system and they found it very useful for improving their presentations. We also compared the system\u0027s output with the observations of a human evaluator. The result shows that the system successfully detected some inappropriate behavior. The contribution of this work is to introduce a practical recognition-based human training system and to show its feasibility despite the limitations of state-of-the-art speech and video recognition technologies.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"17d5bd47-f0ee-355f-946d-37a26ea9a0b0","title":"MultiPresenter: A Presentation System for (Very) Large Display Spaces","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Joel Lanir","Kellogg S Booth","Anthony Tang"],"keywords":["all or part of","displays","high-resolution displays","human-centered design","multiple","or hard copies of","permission to make digital","presentations","this work for"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"content":"We introduce MultiPresenter, a novel presentation system designed to work on very large display spaces (multiple displays or physically large high-resolution displays).

The state-of-the-art solutions to the Big Data problem are largely based on the MapReduce framework (aka its open source implementation Hadoop). Although Hadoop handles the data volume challenge successfully, it does not deal with the data variety well since MapReduce enforces a key-value data model along with a row-oriented data processing strategy and bundles the data processing model with the underlying concurrent programming model. This paper presents epiC, an extensible system to tackle the Big Dataâs data variety challenge. epiC introduces a general Actor-like concurrent programming model, independent of the data processing models, for specifying parallel computations. Users process multi-structured datasets with appropriate epiC extensions, the implementation of a data processing model best suited for the data type and auxiliary code for mapping that data processing model into epiCâs concurrent programming model. Like Hadoop, programs written in this way can be automatically parallelized and the runtime system takes care of fault tolerance and inter-machine communications. We present the design and implementation of epiCâs concurrent programming model. We also present two customized data processing model, an optimized MapReduce extension and a relational model, on top of epiC.

As a result, smart things become easier to build upon. Popular Web languages (e.g., HTML, Python, JavaScript, PHP) can be used to easily build applications involving smart things and users can leverage well-known Web mechanisms (e.g., browsing, searching, bookmarking, caching, linking) to interact and share these devices. In this paper, we begin by describing the Web of Things architecture and best-practices based on the RESTful principles that have already contributed to the popular success, scalability, and modularity of the traditional Web. We then discuss several prototypes designed in accordance with these principles to connect environmental sensor nodes and an energy monitoring system to the World Wide Web.

Contextualized in the broader literature of open science, this article proposes open GIS should include eight dimensions related to data, software, hardware, standards, research, publication, funding, and education. For the GIS community, open GIS offers four exciting opportunities: (1) technology-driven opportunities for addressing challenges posed by the (spatial) big data deluge; (2) application-led opportunities for confronting the problems of a rapidly changing planet; (3) curiosity-inspired, crowd-powered opportunities for the development of an open and geographic citizen science; and (4) education-focused opportunities for implementing the vision of a spatial university. Although there are academic, legal, social/political, and environmental impediments for the practice of open GIS, open GIS will become increasingly important in shaping our research and educational agendas in the future.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"d485e0d7-de2e-3cb9-bf5b-79a96e998f83","title":"Graduate student use of a multi-slate reading system","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Nicholas Chen","FranÃ§ois GuimbretiÃ¨re","Abigail Sellen"],"keywords":["academia","deployment","e-book","e-reading","graduate students","multi-screen computing","multi-slate","reading","tablet"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":["Task- 2 for thesis"],"content":"In laboratory studies, multi-surface slate-based reading sys- tems have shown great promise as platforms for active reading.

This often leads to poor discovery results, because the keywords in the query can be semantically similar but syntactically different, or syntactically similar but semantically different from the terms in a service description. Another drawback of the existing service discovery mechanisms is that the query-service matching score is calculated taking into account only the keywords from the userâs query and the terms in the service descriptions. Thus, regardless of the context of the service user and the context of the services providers, the same list of results is returned in response to a particular query.

For instance, when recommending a holiday destination, a CARS could take into account whether the trip will happen in summer or winter. It is unclear, however, which contextual factors are important and to which degree they influence user ratings. A large amount of data and complex context-aware predictive models must be exploited to understand these relationships. In this paper, we take a new approach for assessing and modeling the relationship between contextual factors and item ratings. Rather than using the traditional approach to data collection, where recommendations are rated with respect to real situations as participants go about their lives as normal, we simulate contextual situations to more easily capture data regarding how the context influences user ratings. To this end, we have designed a methodology whereby users are asked to judge whether a contextual factor (e.g., season) influences the rating given a certain contextual condition (e.g., season is summer). Based on the analyses of these data, we built a context-aware mobile recommender system that utilizes the contextual factors shown to be important. In a subsequent user evaluation, this system was preferred to a similar variant that did not exploit contextual information.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"be635bde-38f8-3a1b-8cb9-f970475faa28","title":"CHIP demonstrator: Semantics-driven recommendations and museum tour generation","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Lora Aroyo","Natalia Stash","Yiwen Wang","Peter Gorgels","Lloyd Rutledge"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"content":"The main objective of the CHIP project is to demonstrate how Semantic Web technologies can be deployed to provide personalized access to digital museum collections.

To provide a more robust approach to context gathering we propose the use of Social Web technologies alongside the Semantic Web. As the social web is heavily used it could provide a better understanding of a userâs interests and intentions. The proposed system gathers information about users from their social web identities and enriches it with ontological knowledge. Thus an interest model for the user can be created which can serve as a good source of contextual knowledge.

The experimental evaluation we performed also confirmed that these recommendation services are really able to catch the real user preferences thus improving their experience in cultural heritage fruition. \u0026copy; 2010 Springer-Verlag.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"42037da2-6eb5-3f36-90c3-9a30bd01359f","title":"Using and Determining Location in a Context-Sensitive Tour Guide: The GUIDE Experience","datatype":"Publication","authors":["N Davies","K Cheverst","K Mitchell","A Efrat"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"kind":"Digital"},{"id":"13e44387-50e4-30f9-990e-f89abd552484","title":"Real-Time News Recommendation Using Context-Aware Ensembles","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Andreas Lommatzsch"],"keywords":["context-aware","online evaluation","real-time recommendations"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"kind":"Digital"},{"id":"8270c4d0-82f6-3461-8d93-6d8d3eb2f455","title":"CROWN : A Context-Aware Recommender for Web News","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Shaoqing Wang","Benyou Zou","Cuiping Li","Kankan Zhao","Qiang Liu","Hong Chen"],"keywords":["[Electronic Manuscript]"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"kind":"Digital"},{"id":"26c276c8-11fb-34ae-9337-2071141a9003","title":"Ontology-Based Personalised and Context-Aware Recommendations of News Items","datatype":"Publication","authors":["I.

Based on the similarities between item descriptions and user profiles, and the se-mantic relations between concepts, content-based and collaborative recommendation models are supported by the system. In this paper, we evaluate a model that personalizes the order in which news articles are shown to the user according to his long-term interest profile, and other model that reorders the news items lists taking into account the current semantic context of interest of the user. The combination of those models is investigated showing significant improvements on the experimental tasks performed.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"1918eabd-17be-3ba4-a309-cea46c98869e","title":"Incorporating context into recommender systems: An empirical comparison of context-based approaches","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Umberto Panniello","Michele Gorgoglione"],"keywords":["Algorithms","Collaborative filtering","Context-aware","Recommender systems"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Recently, there has been growing interest in recommender systems (RSs) and particularly in context-aware RSs. Methods for generating context-aware recommendations were classified into the pre-filtering, post-filtering and contextual modeling approaches. This paper focuses on comparing the pre-filtering, the post-filtering, the contextual modeling and the un-contextual approaches and on identifying which method dominates the others and under which circumstances. Although some of these methods have been studied independently, no prior research compared the relative performance to determine which of them is better. This paper proposes an effective method of comparing the three methods to incorporate context and selecting the best alternatives. As a result, it provides analysts with a practical suggestion on how to pick a good approach in an effective manner to improve the performance of a context-aware recommender system.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"c8b49e46-4a77-3e74-87ad-ebaba16b04c0","title":"Location-adapted music recommendation using tags","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Marius Kaminskas","Francesco Ricci"],"keywords":["context","emotions","location-aware","music","recommender systems","social tagging"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Context-aware music recommender systems are capable to suggest music items taking into consideration contextual conditions, such as the user mood or location, that may influence the user preferences at a particular moment. In this paper we consider a particular kind of context aware recommendation taskâselecting music content that fits a place of interest (POI). To address this problem we have used emotional tags attached by a usersâ population to both music and POIs. Moreover, we have considered a set of similarity metrics for tagged resources to establish a match between music tracks and POIs. In order to test our hypothesis, i.e., that the users will reckon that a music track suits a POI when this track is selected by our approach, we have designed a live user experiment where subjects are repeatedly presented with POIs and a selection of music tracks, some of them matching the presented POI and some not. The results of the experiment show that there is a strong overlap between the usersâ selections and the best matching music that is recommended by the system for a POI.

Once again, the usability crisis is upon us. We suspect most of you thought it was over. After all, HCI certainly understands how to make things usable, so the emphasis has shifted to more engaging topics, such as new applications, new technological developments, and the challenges of social networks and ubiquitous connection and commu- nication. Well, you were wrong. In a recent column for interac- tions, Norman pointed out that in the rush to develop gestural (or ânaturalâ) interfaces, well- tested and understood standards of interaction design were being overthrown, ignored, and violated [1]. Yes, new technologies require new methods, but the refusal to follow well-established principles leads to usability disaster. Recently, Raluca Budui and Hoa Loranger from the Nielsen Norman Group performed usability tests on Appleâs iPad, reaching much the same conclu- sion. The new applications for gestural control in smart cell phones (notably the iPhone and Android devices) and the coming arrival of larger screen devices built upon gestural operating systems (starting with Appleâs iPad) promise even more opportunities for well-intended developers to screw things up. Nielsen put it this way: âThe first crop of iPad apps revived memories of Web designs from 1993, when Mosaic first introduced the image map that made it possible for any part of any picture to become a UI element. As a result, graphic designers went wild: Anything they could draw could be a UI, whether it made sense or not. Itâs the same with iPad apps: Anything you can show and touch can be a UI on this device. There are no standards and no expectations.â [2]","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"3acc88c6-7d0f-35ed-954c-ac728ece5ec6","title":"Radical Atoms : Beyond Tangible Bits , Toward Transformable Materials","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Hiroshi Ishii","DÃ¡vid Lakatos","Leonardo Bonanni","Jean-Baptiste Jb Labrune"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) let users see digital information only through a screen, as if looking into a pool of water, as depicted in Figure 1 on page 40.

Now imagine an iceberg, a mass of ice that penetrates the surface of the water and provides a handle for the mass beneath. This metaphor describes tangible user interfaces: They act as physical manifestations of computation, allowing us to interact directly with the portion that is made tangibleâthe âtip of the icebergâ (Figure 1b). Radical Atoms takes a leap beyond tangible interfaces by assuming a hypothetical generation of materials that can change form and appearance dynamically, so they are as reconfigurable as pixels on a screen. Radical Atoms is a vision for the future of human-material interactions, in which all digital information has physical manifestation so that we can interact directly with itâas if the iceberg had risen from the depths to reveal its sunken mass (Figure 1c).","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"3e42f4a7-5650-363f-aafd-7455710a0e22","title":"Interactive Paper: Past, Present and Future","datatype":"Publication","authors":["Beat Signer","Moira C Norrie"],"keywords":["Anoto","Augmented Paper","Digital Pen and Paper","Interactive Paper","Paper-Digital Interfaces"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:50:17 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Over the last few years, there has been a significant increase in the number of researchers dealing with the integration of paper and digital information or services.

We aim to develop a platform which makes the services, data and the user interface of applications adaptable to different context situations. In this domain, researches have concentrated on how to capture context data and how to carry it to the application. Our work focuses on the impact of context on the application core. In this article, we present the architecture of SECAS, based on a definition of the context suitable for application adaptation, an adaptation strategy based on web services and a case study in the medical field.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"565f4637-78c1-47fb-8a37-5eed5049123b","title":"An Extensible Presentation Tool for Flexible Human-Information Interaction","datatype":"Note","authors":["group5ngui"],"keywords":["An","Extensible","Presentation","Tool","for","Flexible","Human-Information","Interaction"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:53:39 AM","tasks":["Paper for NGUI exam"],"content":"In this demo, we present the MindXpres cross- media presentation tool shown in Figure 1 and highlight its innovative visualisation and navigation concepts.

The state-of-the-art solutions to the Big Data problem are largely based on the MapReduce framework (aka its open source implementation Hadoop). Although Hadoop handles the data volume challenge successfully, it does not deal with the data variety well since MapReduce enforces a key-value data model along with a row-oriented data processing strategy and bundles the data processing model with the underlying concurrent programming model. This paper presents epiC, an extensible system to tackle the Big Data’s data variety challenge. epiC introduces a general Actor-like concurrent programming model, independent of the data processing models, for specifying parallel computations. Users process multi-structured datasets with appropriate epiC extensions, the implementation of a data processing model best suited for the data type and auxiliary code for mapping that data processing model into epiC’s concurrent programming model. Like Hadoop, programs written in this way can be automatically parallelized and the runtime system takes care of fault tolerance and inter-machine communications. We present the design and implementation of epiC’s concurrent programming model. We also present two customized data processing model, an optimized MapReduce extension and a relational model, on top of epiC. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our proposed epiC.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"fc377875-ec8a-4c80-98c2-ec93109e8202","title":"Research training...","datatype":"Note","authors":["group5ngui"],"keywords":["Research","training..."],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:55:15 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Read all related papers and send email to discuss with supervisors.","kind":"Digital"},{"id":"2ea19b09-7be3-4b37-ae31-d312023fdbe3","title":"Task-1 for thesis:","datatype":"Note","authors":["group5ngui"],"keywords":["Task-1","for","thesis:"],"createdDate":"Dec 11, 2015 2:56:02 AM","tasks":[],"content":"Read papers on the basics of Personal Information Management(PIM)Papers: 1) Personal Information Management in Context - Deborah Barreau2) The psychology of personal information management - M.
